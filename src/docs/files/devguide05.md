### How to participate as a bidder

Gnosis Auction is a platform enabling fair price discovery for token distributions. The aim is to make it easy to discover a fair price for their token through the format of a batch auction. To participate as a bidder, you have to perform the following:

#### Connect Wallet

1. First, you need to connect your wallet to the platform. On the top right corner, you can find the button that will allow you to connect your wallet to the Gnosis Auction dapp.

#### Bidding in an Auction

A typical auction page looks like below:

This page contains 3 key sections:

- At the top, we have the Auction Details. These include key parameters regarding the auction.
- Secondly, we have the Place Order section. Here you can place an order as well as track the current price of the token.
- Finally, the Your Order section allows bidders to see the token orders they have placed for the auction.


But, let's go into details about what each section of the UI means.

> 1. This parameter indicates the total amount of tokens the auctioneer is auctioning. This number represents the total amount of tokens available to be bought by bidders.

> 2. This parameter represents the token that the auctioneer has selected to be the one accepted for bidding in the auction. This is the asset you need to bid with.

> 3. This parameter shows a countdown of the duration of the auction. This parameter marks when the auction will end.

> 4. This parameter shows the closing price of the auction if no more bids are submitted or canceled. As a bidder, you simply need to bid above this price for higher possibility to place a successful bid.

> 5. This parameter is the starting price of token auctioned. The auctioneer has decided its value and it establishes the fact that bidders can’t bid under this price.

> 6. The amount parameter, is the amount of bidding tokens you are willing to pay for the auctioned tokens.

> 7. The price per bid-token/auction token parameter is the max bid price you are willing to offer per token auctioned.

> 8.  The white line indicates the current price, which will be the auction's closing price if no more bids are submitted or canceled. The dotted line will dynamically move with new bids.

> 9. The green line shows the price and size of the bids that have been placed, only the part of the right side of the white line marks the bids that will be successful at the end of the sale.

6. If it is the first time that you have used that token to bid, you will have to approve the smart contract to spend that token. First click on the "Approve" button, and then confirm the transaction on Metamask, as shown below.

7. After you have set both the amount of tokens to bid, and the price per bid-token/auction token, you no longer see the enter amount section, instead you see a colored bar with the words “Place Order”. Once you are sure about the parameters you have inputted you have to click on “place order” to include your bid in the auction.

8. Once you have clicked on “Place Order”, a confirmation popup will appear that will ask you to confirm the order. As you can see in the image below, the dapp confirmation shows the relevant information of your bid order.

9. After you have clicked on “Confirm Order”, your wallet will trigger a popup for confirming the transaction. In this case, the Metamask popup will appear asking you to confirm the execution of the transaction from your wallet interface.

10. Once the Metamask order has been confirmed, and the transaction has been mined into a block, under the “Your Orders” section of the dapp you will see all the details of your bidding order, and a link to Etherscan so that you can check your transaction status.
